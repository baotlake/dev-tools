        <h1>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>
        <p>
            Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types
            of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for
            everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware distribution.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSP is designed to be fully backward compatible (except CSP version 2 where there are some
            explicitly-mentioned inconsistencies in backward compatibility; more details here section 1.1). Browsers
            that don't support it still work with servers that implement it, and vice versa: browsers that don't support
            CSP ignore it, functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard same-origin policy for web content. If the
            site doesn't offer the CSP header, browsers likewise use the standard same-origin policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            To enable CSP, you need to configure your web server to return the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header.
            (Sometimes you may see mentions of the X-Content-Security-Policy header, but that's an older version and you
            don't need to specify it anymore.)
